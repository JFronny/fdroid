# JFronnys F-Droid Repository
This is a repository of open-source apps to be used with F-Droid.
Applications in this repository are official binaries built by the original application developers.
I do not own the applications or any content available through those applications and simply provide a common location for downloading them.
You can view all applications in this repository or add it to your client [here](https://jfronny.gitlab.io/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=937AD37D4C667BC0FFD48C4B26B35141BC3683EA0282B005B89CBB703AE3A587).

## License
The scripts in this repository are based on those made for [fdroid-firefox](https://gitlab.com/rfc2822/fdroid-firefox).
I provide any changes I made to them under the MIT license.
The metadata and generated repository contain text, images and binaries not owned by me and, as such, may not be available for your use.
