Summary: A fork of signal without google
Description: |-
    Molly is a hardened version of Signal for Android, the fast simple yet secure messaging app by Signal Foundation.
    
    Back in 2018, Signal allowed the user to set a passphrase to secure the local message database. But this option was removed with the introduction of full-disk encryption on Android. Molly brings it back again with additional security features.
    
    Molly is updated every two weeks to include the latest Signal changes and bug fixes.
