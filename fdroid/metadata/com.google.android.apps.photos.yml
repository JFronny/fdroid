Summary: Google Photos Proxy for use with GCam
Description: |-
    GCamPhotosProxy fixes the gallery icon in GCam by registring an activity for google photos which launches the native gallery app.
    If this application is listed as installed even though you did not do so, you can safely ignore it.
    Since this application uses the google photos app id, F-Droid may recognize the original google photos app instead.
