Summary: Browse root directories from any file manager
Description: |-
    SzBnd is a small utility app that allows you to browse root directories from any file manager app.
    It works by providing a DocumentsProvider that file managers can use to access the filesystem.
    This is especially useful for file managers that do not have root access themselves, but can use content providers to access files.
