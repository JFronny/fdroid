Summary: A simple, rational music player with bottom navigation and library reloading
Description: |-
    Auxio is a local music player with a fast, reliable UI/UX without the many useless features present in other music players
    In addition to the features provided upstream, this fork enhances library reloading to *actually* reload the media store from local files
    and provides a more comfortable bottom navigation system.
