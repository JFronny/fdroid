Summary: Fully featured email client. Neat, intuitive user interface. Privacy friendly
Description: |
    FairEmail is easy to setup and works with virtually all email providers, including Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo!

    Note that OAuth was not approved for the F-Droid build. For this you'll need to use the Play store version or the GitHub release.

    FairEmail might be for you if you value your privacy.

    FairEmail is an email client only, so you need to bring your own email address.

    FairEmail does not support non-standard protocols, like Microsoft Exchange Web Services and Microsoft ActiveSync.
